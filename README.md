3. 📂 What is the sales distribution by **sub-category**?
4. 💰 What is the **monthly profit** trend? Identify the **highest profit month**.
5. 📈 What are the **profits by category and sub-category**?
6. 👥 How do **sales and profits vary across customer segments**?
7. 📉 What is the **sales-to-profit ratio**, and what insights can be drawn from it?
